# tel-choir

Tel-choir is a group singing experience that anyone can participate in, one phone call at a time. Each time you call, you'll be prompted to sing one note. (We'll help you stay in tune.) At the end of the event, everyone's contributions will be collected into one song â€” much like a bell choir, where each musician holds a tuned bell and chimes in one note at a time.
